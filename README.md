# Raspberry Pi Pico W FreeRTOS Robot
This project is a proof of concept for controling a robotic car using FreeRTOS running on a raspberry pi pico W. It also takes advantage of the fairly new btstack library to communicate over bluetooth. This allows the robot to be controlled via an xbox controller connected to a computer running another script I wrote on [GitHub](https://github.com/PrestonGardner5081/bt_key_caputure). 

The source code for this project is located under the RTOS_RC directory with the entry point in main.c
